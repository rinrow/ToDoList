# ToDoList
 This is the my first app which was created and continue creating with WindowsForm framework
It was made to learn two things: 
   1How to make apps with WindowsForms and other apps like this, 
   2 How and when apply design patterns(patterns from book of band of four) 
   
I wish to make it into the big project
